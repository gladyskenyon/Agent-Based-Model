## Introduction
This portfolio has been created for assignment one of the week intensive Leeds University GEOG995 Core programming course. 
It contains the final practical script and several outputs (figures and files), which were created using Python in Spyder. The code has detailed documentation to show understanding.

There are three key componants to the model:
* model.py- contains code to set up and control the model
* agentframework.py- contains the Agent class, which builds agents and their behaviour
* in.txt- contains the environment which the agents will interact with    

These all need to be dowloaded in the same directory to run the model.
